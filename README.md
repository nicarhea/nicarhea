        	HTML documents can easily be identified because it has a <strong> .htm or .html </strong> file extension. There is no difference between htm or .html. In the past, web servers only used four letter extension names, however, due to advancement, web servers started accepting long extension names. <em>We recommend that you use .html in saving your page file. </em>

        	<strong> The Unicode Transformation Format (UTF) </strong> encodes all characters, punctuations, and symbols defined by Unicode. Unicode is for encoding a given document as a sequence of bytes. The <strong>'8'</strong> means it uses 8-bit blocks to represent any character responsible in the Unicode standard. <em>The default character encoding in HTML5 is UTF8. </em> <strong> UTF-8 </strong> is the principal character encoding for the <strong> World Wide Web. </strong>

        	It is better to view the page in <strong> several browsers </strong> since you don't know which particular browser your visitors will be using. You should also consider that different browsers don't always render pages in exactly the same way.

        	<strong> HTML5 </strong> is less restrictive than HTML4. It is not case-sensitive; you can enter tags in uppercase or lowercase.
